    	<p>Rootconf is Indiaâ€™s principal conference where systems and operations engineers share real world knowledge about building resilient and scalable systems. This year's edition is on 14 - 15 April 2016 at MLR Convention Center, JP Nagar, Bangalore.</p>
      <p>The theme for this edition will be learning from failure. We are keen to explore how devops think about failure when designing, building and scaling their systems. We invite presentations related to failure in database systems, servers and network infrastructure. </p>
      <p>We encourage presentations that relate to failure not only in terms of avoidance but also in terms of mitigation and education. How do we decide which parts of our systems cannot fail? What measures do we take to mitigate failure when it does inevitably happen? And most importantly: what lessons can be learned from failure?
